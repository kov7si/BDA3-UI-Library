# BDA3-UI-Library

A component Library with frequently used Components written in React.js along with Unit-tests and Storybook integration.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Testing

You can run the tests using following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used as the testing framework.

In addition, the project uses [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) for better React component support.
